## Monday Notes

- Python Knowledge, prior to this module:
    - Knowledge of the data structures
    - Seen some code examples
    - Read about the language a little

- Utilised my industry experience to apply Scrum and development practices from XP like CI, Code Standards, Source Management - Pull Requests, Branching and use of Jira

Task completed today:

- Python statements, specifically list comprehension and test
- Work on project outline:
    - Refined the tasks â€” added more detail to some of the prioritised requirements
    - Refined the deliverables into a simplified list
- Started adding final sections to the Overleaf document from Grammarly
- After tasks in Project Outline were refined with more detail, I also adjusted the Jira Epics for the respective requirements

# Tuesday

- Project Outline
    - Reducing it to 4 pages from 5 page
- Planning on migrating the Jira project to a classic project to more of the features I would expect like being able to see the sub tasks on the board and ?
- Had trouble figuring out the concrete requirements for the project and planning how much I could do, so I am glad I choose Agile for its flexibility and ability for requirements to evolve as more knowledge is gained
    - But I managed to create a decent list of requirements that can. be used as a basis for the project, but may change as I work on the project
    - Research into Sentiment Orientation, Pre-processing
- Look at the existing data set: [https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews](https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews)
