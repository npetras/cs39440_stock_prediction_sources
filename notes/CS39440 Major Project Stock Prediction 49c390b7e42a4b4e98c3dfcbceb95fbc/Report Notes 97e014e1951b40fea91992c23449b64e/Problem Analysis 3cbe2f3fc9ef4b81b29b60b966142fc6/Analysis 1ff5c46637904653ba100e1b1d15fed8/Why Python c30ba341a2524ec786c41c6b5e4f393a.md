[https://www.nltk.org/book/ch00.html](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch00.html) - Why Python?

- Very popular in Machine Learning, Data Science and NLP community
    - Large amount of quality libraries: NLTK, spaCy, Panas, numpy and many others
    - Large community - resources, help, guides
    - All tutorials I was finding online was Python focused, to find Java tutorials you would have to search specifically for Java examples. Kotlin tutorials would likely be even scarcer.
    - Especially popular for sentiment analysis, because of NLTK, and its features for text manipulation
- Language itself
    - Easy to use, write
    - Lots of capabilities for language proccessing
    - Readible
    - Quick and easy to write code, due to its dynamic nature

    - The JVM languages: Java and Kotlin, which I am most compotent with
        - Kotlin very nice language to write in and use, even if a little more complex than Python
        - The library eco-system and community is much more limited than for Python

    - Also a very useful language for scripting and other applications apart from Machine Learning, making a very worthwhile technology to learn

    - Easy to write code: dynamically typed
    - Useful features like slicing for sequence data: lists (arrays) and strings

    - Bad: An interpreted language, so errors are always runtime errors, not caught before, can be costly if they are late in the code, and it takes a long time to run the code
        - More error prone?
    - Very flexible data types, can mix differnt types of data together ery easily
    - Did not have much experience with the language myself!

    - Find code and documentation harder to understand, because there are no types

- Got convinced by other computer science friends that seen it as the only language they would want to use for Machine Learning
    - Had little experience with Python myself
    - None for Machine Learning, but everyone seemed to recommend it
    - & it had a large community and libraries for Machine Learning and NLP

    # Reflection

    - Slow performance for tasks do to with pre-processing
