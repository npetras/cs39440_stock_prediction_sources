# Methodology

# Organising and Planning Work

I have chosen an agile methodology for my project because personally, I think it is a much better approach than plan-based for software development and the future. I see little advantages in plan-based approaches. 

- Supervisor will not agree

The specific agile methodology that was chosen was Scrum, because of effective planning framework, better than others like Kanban and Extreme Programming. Kanban is too simple with no deadline pressure, little structure. Extreme Programming is too prescriptive with the way developers should approach problems, and does not offer as much structure as Scrum with the Scrum events. And the most effective XP practices that are suited to a specific project can still be adopted as part of the day-to-day work inside of Scrum.  

Even though I am using the Scrum methodology I have adopted effective practices from the other agile methodologies that were considered: WIP limits from Kanban, to keep myself focused on a maximum of two tasks/stories, and only allowing one of these issues in the review column. As well as software development practices seen as good practice in the industry, as well as being part of XP practices: code guidelines, ..., ..., ?

## Roles

I have taken on all the traditional roles in a software and/or research project when considering scrum itself I have taken on the product owner, scrum master and development team roles. Development teams roles include several: developer, tester, quality assurance, operations

- Product Owner and Customer: Acted as both
    - Choosing priorities
    - Expressing The features, stories that need to be developed for the software to be useful, satisfactory
        - writing those stories from a customer perspective, when possible
            - splitting them according to developer estimates, and expertise
- General development team:
    - estimation
    - completing the daily work required to satisfy requirements (stories, epics)
    - Scrum Events
- Developer
- Quality assurance, testing:
    - git repository managements
    - software quality
    - testing - unit testing, utilising TDD for better testing and design outcomes

    Created the stories and epics from a customer perspective, but created lots of tasks from the developer perspective inside the Epics. 

    - Found it hard to model everything as a story and a more granular level â€” beyond epics and stories that fit into one-week sprints

    # Development

    - Would like to use TTD, now I have learned how to do Unit Testing in Python
    - Code Conventions: Google Code Style
        - Not yet using, but plan on using in future, and in 'production' software
    - CI Build will hopefully be integrated

    # Tools

    - Git, GitHub, Jira, ?
