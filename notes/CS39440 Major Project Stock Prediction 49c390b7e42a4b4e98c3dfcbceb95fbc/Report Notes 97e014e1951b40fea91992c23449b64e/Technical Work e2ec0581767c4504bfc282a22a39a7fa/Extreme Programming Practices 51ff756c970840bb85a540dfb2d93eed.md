# Extreme Programming Practices

- During some work, especially when its research or spike coding, the XP practices may not be followed if they impede the exercise's goal
- TDD:
    - During spikes that were the result of tutorials and while I was learning Python, TDD was not utilised, but after I learned about how to perform unit testing in Python, I started using the practice in my work
- Continous Integration:
    - When I was working with code, I committed my changes at least one a day to the development branch
    - Each branch was merged with master, every one to two days
    - CI was not as critical as in larger teams, but was still a good practice to adopt to make sure all my code worked together
    - CI Build acted as a gatekeeper â€” ensuring my code worked standalone and with the other units before being merged to the master branch
