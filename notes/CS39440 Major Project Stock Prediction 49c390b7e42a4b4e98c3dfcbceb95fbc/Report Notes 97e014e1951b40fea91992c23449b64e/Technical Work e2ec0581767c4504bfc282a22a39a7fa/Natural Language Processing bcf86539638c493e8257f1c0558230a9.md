# Stemming vs Lemmatisation

[https://towardsdatascience.com/stemming-vs-lemmatization-2daddabcb221](https://towardsdatascience.com/stemming-vs-lemmatization-2daddabcb221)

- Stemming is simpler and produces stems of words â€” which may not be words in themselves
- Lemmatisation goes beyond "word reduction and considers a language's full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words"
- Stemming is faster than lemmatisation
- Lemmatisation is seen as more sophisticated and informative than stemming
- Essentially a trade-off between accuracy and speed
