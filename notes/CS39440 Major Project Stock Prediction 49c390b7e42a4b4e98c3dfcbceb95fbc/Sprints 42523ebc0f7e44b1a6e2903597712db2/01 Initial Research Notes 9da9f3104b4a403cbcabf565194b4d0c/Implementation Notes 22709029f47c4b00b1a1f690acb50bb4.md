# Implementation Notes

- Headlines Analysis
- Need to measure sentiment of these headlines: positive, negative, neutral
    - Including degree of this sentiment
- Translate this sentiment to the predicted in stock price change over a day, week, month, year or more
    - Take into account the volatility of the stock? - or does this happen in the learning process
- Create per stock learners
- Then maybe create more general stock predictors â€” like a human pundit
- Start with just tagging headlines: positive, neutral or negative

- **Take into account strength of previous sentiment**
- Markets open Mon-Fri
- Make predictions for daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly price increases
    - Maybe even year end price prediction
    - Each one will be updated with new data
    - After a month of training/prediction?

- Incorporate data from stock analysts
    - Should be incorporated through news
    - Separate section/category for this? - higher weighting

- Could incorporate sentiment and aspect-based analysis together
    - Postive, negative
    - Indicators - Stock expected to grow 20% in next few months

- Trusted, more reliable news sources:
    - Financial Times
    - Wall Street Journal
    - Yahoo Finance
    - Investors Business Daily
    - Barrons

- Add tool to include an investment amount, and prediction of the increase and decrease in real and percentage terms?

- Utilise a dictionary alongside a Machine Learning approach
