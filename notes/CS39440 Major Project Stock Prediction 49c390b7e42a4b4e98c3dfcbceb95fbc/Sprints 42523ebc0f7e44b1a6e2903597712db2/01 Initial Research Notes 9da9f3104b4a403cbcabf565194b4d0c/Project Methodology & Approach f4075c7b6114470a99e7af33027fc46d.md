# Project Methodology & Approach

# Methodology

## Sprint Structure

- Scrum Sprints - 2 weeks (Agile)
- Sprint Planning (approx. 1 hr)
- Backlog Grooming/Refinement - ongoing process during each sprint
    - Includes creating issues, and estimating those issues
- Personal Sprint Retrospective & Review
    - 20-30 mins each
- Sprint Review to Supervisor?
    - 10-15 mins?
- Personal Daily Stand-Up
    - Check board everyday at a set time, evaluate what the focus for the day will be, what problems I have encountered, and move any cards that require moving

## Roles, Issues and Estimation

- No specific Product Owner, I take the role of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team

- Stories/Epics - Overall Requirements
- Tasks & Sub-tasks - Implementation of the Stories and Epics is smaller chunks
- Spikes - Research that will result in stories, epics and tasks

- Estimation for stories and tasks - in ideal days
    - 2 = 1 ideal day (8 hrs approx.)
- Time recording for spikes

## Practices

- Use development practices from XP to guide my work: TDD, refactoring, continuous integration, simple design, coding standards, system metaphor
- Other practices: semantic versioning, conventional commits
- Using WIP limits from Kanban, to ensure I focus on one to two items at a time, reduicng task switching which decreases productivity

# Problem Approach

- Research into different approaches
    - Choose an initial 'simple' approach, likely a Bayes based method
- Then try more different (possible more advanced) approaches
    - Bayes Belief Networks (if not used before)
    - Neural nets
    - Fuzzy Systems

- Focus one specific stock first
- Apply simple approach to multiple stocks
    - Unique model for each stock
- Attempt to generalise simple approach for multiple stocks
