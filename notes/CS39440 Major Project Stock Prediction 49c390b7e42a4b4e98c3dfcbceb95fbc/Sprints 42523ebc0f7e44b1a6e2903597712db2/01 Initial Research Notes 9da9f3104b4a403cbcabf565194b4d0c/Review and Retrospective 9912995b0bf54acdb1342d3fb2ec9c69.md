# Review and Retrospective

Lost information on the Sprint when I moved to a classical project - not sprint report or burn-down charts, but can still see what issues were completed

# Review

- Lots of adjustments, issues being added and removed, since it was the first Sprint in the project and I was uncertain about what I was going to work on, assume this will improve this type around
- Managed to complete:
    - Initial research into the problem, including some spike work on sentiment analysis and pre-processing data
        - Scraping data off news and social media sites
    - Clear up most of the focus of the project (requirements)
        - Including completion of the project outline
        - Some technologies I am going to use: Python
    - Python Basics

    - Sprint Goal progress was definitely made, but still some work to do before implementing the firs approach

    # Retrospective

    Possible improvements:

    - Be more focused
    - Using week-long sprints instead of two-weeks
        - Lines up nicely with my supervisor meetings
        - Will also help give me greater focus
    - Work on refining longer term plan
