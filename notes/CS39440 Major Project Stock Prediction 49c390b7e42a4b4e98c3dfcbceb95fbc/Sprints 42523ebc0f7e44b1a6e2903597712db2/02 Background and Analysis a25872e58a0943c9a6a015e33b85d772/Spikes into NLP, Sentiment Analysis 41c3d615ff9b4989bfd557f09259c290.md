# Spikes into NLP, Sentiment Analysis

Conitnuation of: 

- VADER: Sentiment Analysis Tool, large lexicon, tuned specially for social media, part of nltk, provides values for positive, neutral and negative sentiment in a particular piece of text. As well as a compound score, taking into account the intensity of each.
    - Looks good for my work

# General Notes

- data frame: table or or 2D array-like structure
    - Used in pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)
- regression is for stock market prediction not classification?
    - [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- regression: denoting the strength and character of a relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables
- feature_extraction
- model_selection
- nltk.corpus - dictionary, collection of text data sets (e.g. all stop words)
- stemming and lemmatisation:
- tokenize
- r'' in Python - raw string, used in RegEx to retain backslashes
- stemming and lemmatisation are not the same, see Stemming vs Lemmatisation Section in:
- vectorizer: "mapping words and phrases from vocabulary to corresponding vector or rea; numbers which are used to find word predictions, similarities and semantics"

- evaluation methods:
    - precision
    - recall
    - F1:
- confusion matrix:
- tokenize: split up string in to separate words 'tokens'
